# Computing Resources for Harvey-affected Scientists  

Our lab found ourselves wondering, can we help data/computational scientists dealing with Harvey by providing compute resources?

We can set up a cluster using one or more commercial clouds that appears as a Beowulf cluster with a scheduler (e.g., Sun Grid Engine) and other software. If you're a scientist affected by Harvey, is this helpful to you at all? If so, what software do you use?

Please file a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/greenelab/harv-compute/issues) to help us understand your needs.

Thanks!
Casey (& the lab)
